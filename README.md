# World-Cup-Database
Submission for the freeCodeCamp Relational Database project.

A PostgreSQL database on world cup games with two tables: "games" and "teams". 
The bash script "insert_data.sh" inserts data on world cup games from a CSV file into PostgreSQL tables. "queries.sh" queries the tables for info and echoes the results.
